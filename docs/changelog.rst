Tagulous follows semantic versioning in the format ``BREAKING.FEATURE.BUG``:

* ``BREAKING`` will be marked with links to the details and upgrade instructions in
  :doc:`upgrading`.
* ``FEATURE`` and ``BUG`` releases will be safe to install without reading the upgrade
  notes.

Changes for upcoming releases will be listed without a release date - these
are available by installing the develop branch from github.
